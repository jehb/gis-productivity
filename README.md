# GIS Productivity Hacks

This repository is for keeping track of various things related to [my talk](https://event.crowdcompass.com/ncgis2017/activity/rqq4MnEiRT) at the [NC GIS Conference](http://www.ncgisconference.com/) on February 23, 2017 in Raleigh, NC.

The talk was originally pitched as a modification to the talk given by me and Jen Wike Huger at All Things Open in 2016, entitled [Open Source Productivity Hacks](https://github.com/jehb/productivity-hacks). It has since diverged pretty significantly from that presentation, but I'm linking it here in case you'd like to see those slides or have a follow-up that might be better answered there.

## Tools I use

I'm a weekend warrior when it comes to GIS. I spend a lot of time in my day job doing analytics and automation, but most of it doesn't have a geospatial component.

* vim (or a text editor of your choosing)
* ImageMagick
* A chatbot
* Docker
* Vagrant
* ImageMagick
* Command line CSV manipulation
* Node-RED
* Jupyter notebooks

## Why hack your productivity?

Tools are changing fast. In just a couple of years, whatever tool you're using today is almost guaranteed to be obsolete. So what do you do?

Focus on the processes, not just the tools.

So we're going to take a whirlwind tour of a bunch of the tools I use, but again, it's not about the tools, it's about applying concepts as broadly as you can. So while I'm a tool geek, don't let me get caught up in the tools themselves.

## Pick a sample spot

One of the things I picked up when I was in grad school for learning new tools is to have one data set you're intimately familiar with, so you can quickly try out new tools, see how they work, and if they're for you. If you went through a MS or PhD program, or if you're the data manager for a particular geographic region, this will come easy to you.

I do a lot of urban planning advocacy, so a dataset I'm prety familiar with is my own neighbhorhood in Chapel Hill.
