    "Download the data from the [NC State Board of Elections](https://www.ncsbe.gov/). There used to be an actual, clean FTP site for downloading the data, but some time in 2016 the BOE opted to move everything to Amazon S3 and gave it a fake [FTP-like interface](http://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html?prefix=data/) for browsing election data. Kind of annoying, but, it could be worse.\n",

    "The action voter database along with voter history lives in the [/data/](http://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html?prefix=data/) directory. You can download the data for the entire state, but for sanity purposes, if you don't need the entire state, I recommend just grabbing the county data that you need. That's how this notebook is initially set up. County data is listed numerically by the number that a county appears in if arranged alphabetically. Go figure. Since that's pretty cryptic, I recommend reading the data format [description file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/data/ncvhis_ncvoter_data_format.txt), which will also help you figure out what each of the columns represents."
